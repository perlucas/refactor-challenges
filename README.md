# Refactoring Challenges
Refactoring challenges repository. Look at the different samples of refactoring applying OOP techniques and approaches. Hopefully this will provide useful insight on how to approach a refactoring with a view to achieving SOLID implementations.

Each _refactor_ folder contains an example of code that begs for a refactor. I provide a brief explanation of what the code does, and a _refactor-solved_ folder which contains the resulting refactored code. Try to come up with your own refactors before peeking at mine if you want to practice your refactoring and OOP thinking skills.
